   I'm Keerthi Krishna.K and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications in Bharathiar University, Coimbatore. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with a CGPA of 9.1. I'm currently looking forward for good Internship Opportunities and enhance my skillsets. I have done my Mini project with Django Framework (it's basically an Ecommerce website with Augmented Reality enabled Shopping Experience). I look forward to learn from professionals with real-world projects and I hope this internship will strengthen my resume and offers an opportunity for my personal growth too. Thank You.


   1. I can quickly adjust to new environments and work in groups.
2. I have good communication and Problem-solving skills.
3.I've Already worked with Django Framework so I do have a foundation on it and can work efficiently

I want to gain hands-on experience with python frameworks, which would help me build a strong technical foundation and knowledge to real-world problems.

I aim to enhance my ability to analyze and resolve technical issues efficiently, which is crucial for a successful IT career.

I aim to improve my time management skills
